## Research Assistant 
*Year 2019 - Year 2021*

Following my internship at Julius Kühn Institute, I was offered to work on another project, &quot;Rain-
resistant delivery technology to protect the vine from spotted wing Drosophila (Drosophila suzukii)&quot;. The
aim of the project was to validate the use of GreenGel (a biopesticide) as a rain-resistant delivery
technology for the effective control of grapevine pests with reduced use of pesticides. Therefore, we
designed a laboratory experiment to investigate the relationship between the degree of wetting of the
berry and the walking activity of the animals in order to achieve an optimal insecticidal effect on the
adult flies.
 
After working there almost one year I shifted to the university (University of Koblenz-Landau). Currently
I am working with a PhD student under the project, &quot;[SystemLink](https://systemlink.uni-landau.de/)&quot;. I am mainly handling the rearing of
Chironomus spp. as well as helping with the chronic experiment of adaptation of Chironomus spp. to
anthropogenic stress.

## Internship
*Year 2019*

From June 2019 to July 2019, I got an opportunity to conduct my internship at [Julius Kühn Institute,
Siebeldingen](https://www.julius-kuehn.de/en/ow/). Here, I assisted a Ph.D. student in her research work, which was to investigate the effect
of different mixture of plant protection products on sacle insect (Pseudococcus viburni), a vector of virus
transmitting disease in the vineyard and their natural enemy (Acerophagus maculipennis). I was
responsible for the experimental setup, handling of test organisms and collection of data. Additionally, I
was also involved with other projects, such as rearing of Eupoecilia ambiguella and Lobesia botrana,
insect segregation (primarily spider) collected from pitfall traps, mating behavior of Eupoecilia
ambiguella, DNA extraction, and PCR.

## Assistant Consultant (Environment), EQMS Consulting Limited
*Year 2018*

The year following my graduation, I took an Assistant Consultant (Environment) position at [EQMS
Consulting Limited](http://eqms.com.bd/) and worked there for six months (April, 2018 - September, 2018). This unique
position included diverse tasks from scientific monitoring to program management.
- Conducted 5 field surveys under the project, &quot;Construction of important bridges on rural roads
project in Bangladesh&quot; and prepared Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report for that.
- Organized and managed 5 public consultation meetings to educate local people about the pros
and cons of constructing a bridge in their area.

## Research Assistant 
*Year 2015 - Year 2017*

Beside my coursework in the Master&#39;s program at University of Dhaka, I assisted [Prof. Dr. Sirajul Hoque](https://www.du.ac.bd/faculty/faculty_details/SSC/1692)
in his collaborative research work. My responsibilities included, elemental analysis of soil nutrients by
conventional techniques and analyzing the data.
