Hi there! I am Sumaiya Chowdhury, currently working toward getting a Master's degree in [Ecotoxicology](https://www.uni-koblenz-landau.de/de/landau/fb7/studieninteressierte/master-ecotoxicology) at the
[University of Koblenz-Landau](https://www.uni-koblenz-landau.de/de/landau), Germany.

I have always been drawn to nature and environment, which eventually led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree and a Master's degree in soil and
environmental science at the [University of Dhaka](https://www.du.ac.bd), Bangladesh. During my Master’s thesis, I found a passion for toxicology and decided to continue with another Master's program. 

At present, I am working on my Master’s thesis, as part of my curriculam at the University of Koblenz-Landau, where I am investigating the chemical sensitivity of spiders.

I consider myself a ‘***forever student***’, who is eager to build on her academic foundations with hands on
experience in latest techniques. I cannot tell how exactly my personal roadmap will look like in the future but I am always up for new
challenges and pretty much willing to take on the responsibilities to achieve my personal goals and
those of my peers.
 
I hope you have a great time navigating my website. Thanks for visiting!
